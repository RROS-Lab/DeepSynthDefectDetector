# Synthetic Image Assisted Deep Learning Framework for Detecting Defects During Composite Sheet Layup
The repository consists of the codebase and dataset for work presented at ASME's IDETC-CIE Conference, 2022

The link to the entire annotated dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/191EgISHWs6FH6FCKOSBTKoLQjo29bWh0?usp=sharing
In case there are any issues accessing the dataset kindly reach out via email to: manyar@usc.edu or guptask@usc.edu

The codebase consists of two subfolders:
## Synthetic Image Generation
The Synthetic Image Generation module contains the Texture File of Carbon Fiber, Procedure to Generate your own texture and also talks about generation of synthetic images 
The code, blender file and procedure to generate synthetic images can be found [here](https://github.com/RROS-Lab/DeepSynthDefectDetector/tree/master/SyntheticImageGeneration)

## ResNest-based Image Segmentation Model
The image segmentation module is based on the ResNest Framework
The code and implementation details are discussed [here](https://github.com/RROS-Lab/DeepSynthDefectDetector/tree/master/ResNeSTImageSegmentation)
